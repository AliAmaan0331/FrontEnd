This project is developed by watching udemy course.

In this app users can upload loctions with images and description and other users can see them.

So it is basically a location sharing app!

The two main entities we have are users and places.

To start the project clone the repository, delete node modules, run npm install and then run the following commands:

1) npm install --save react-router-dom@5 --save-exact
2)npm i react-transition-group

Finally run npm start!
